1, CommonJS module system

CommonJS is a module specification for JavaScript that defines how modules can be loaded and used in a program. 
It was created to address the lack of a standard module system in JavaScript, and it has since become widely adopted by the Node.js community.

In the CommonJS module system, a module is defined as a separate file that contains a set of related functions, objects, or values. 
These modules can be loaded into a program using the require function, which takes the path to the module file as an argument.

Each module in CommonJS has its own scope, which means that the variables and functions defined in one module are not visible in another 
module unless they are explicitly exported and imported. 
To export a value or function from a module, the module.exports object is used. 
To import a value or function from another module, the require function is used.

Here's an example of a CommonJS module that exports a single function:

javascript

// greeting.js
function sayHello(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

module.exports = sayHello;

In this example, the greeting.js file defines a single function called sayHello, 
which takes a name as an argument and logs a greeting to the console. 
The module.exports statement at the end of the file exports the sayHello function so that it can be used in other modules.

Here's an example of how the sayHello function could be used in another module:

javascript

// app.js
const sayHello = require('./greeting.js');

sayHello('Alice'); // Output: "Hello, Alice!"

In this example, the app.js file uses the require function to import the sayHello function from the greeting.js module. 
It then calls the sayHello function with the name "Alice", which logs a greeting to the console.





2,ES6 module system

ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, introduced a new module system for JavaScript that allows for more efficient and flexible management of modules.
The ES6 module system uses a syntax that is similar to the CommonJS module system, but with some key differences.

In the ES6 module system, modules are defined using the export keyword, which specifies which variables, 
functions, or objects should be exported from the module. 
Modules can also import functionality from other modules using the import keyword.
