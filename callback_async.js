/*
Asynchronous callbacks
An asynchronous callback is executed after the execution of the "high-order function" that uses the "callback".

Asynchronicity means that if JavaScript has to wait for an operation to complete, it will execute the rest of the code while waiting.

Note that JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language. It carries asynchronous operations via the callback queue and event loop.
